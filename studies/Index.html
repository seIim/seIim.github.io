        In my undergraduate degree I loved independently studying math, or studying directly under a supervisor guiding me through a subject.
       Here is a short list of projects and independent studies I took on with professors at my university.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong> MAT496 Capstone Project</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
        <a class="link" href="src/Capstone.html"> notebook</a>. <br>
      </p>
      <strong> PHY499 Introduction to Quantum Field Theory</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
        Under Prof. Carolina Ilie, a small group of students and I worked through Quantum Field Theory for The Gifted Amateur, by (author). This is 
        currently a work in progress! I am uploading my solutions to homeworks here: (link). 
      </p>
      <strong> PHY496 Senior Research Project</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
        In the Fall23 Semester I dedicated my senior research project as an extension to the work I did at my research experiences over the last three summers in computational astrophysics.
        I summarized my results in (paper) and through the semester I built up the theory of stellar pulsations, working through (book). This class culimated in an undergraduate thesis paper where
        prsented the theory of stellar pulsation for radially pulsating stars, and then the computational methods associated with modeling it. That work is here: (paper).
      </p>
      <strong> AST499 General Relativity</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
      In the Fall22 semester I worked with Dr. Shashi Kanbur in the Physics Department to complete an independent study in General Relativity. The book
      used was <a class="link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/a-first-course-in-general-relativity/933C1A8C84420EF1349B676F0D70A065#overview"> A First Course in General Relativity, by Bernard Shutz </a>. 
      To complete this independent study, I gave a presentation to the math and physics department
      where I derived the curvature tensor. That presentation is located here:
        <a class="link" href="src/General_Relativity_Presentation.pdf"> General Relativity and Curvature</a> <br>
      Later, as a project for my astrophysics class I revisited the book and worked through
       the derivation for the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equation, and presented it at QUEST, where I won a presenters award:
       <a class="link" href="src/AST405 QUEST.pptx">The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equation</a>
      </p>
      <strong> MAT499 Machine Learning</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
      Over the Spring23 Semester Dr. <a class="'link" href="https://www.johnmyersmath.com/home"> John Meyers</a> and I read through 
      <a class="'link" href="https://mlstory.org/"> Patterns, Predictions, and Actions</a>; a book that details an introduction to the 
      mathematical framework of prediction and machine learning. This book starts with Bayesian prediction and works its way through supervised learning. This class culminated
      in projects where I would code prediction frameworks and models from scratch, using resources from the available literature.
      </p>
      <strong> MAT499 Geometry, Topology, and Physics</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
        Also over the Spring23 semester Dr. Indu-Rasika and I read through the book <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Topology-Physics-Graduate-Student/dp/0750306068"> Geometry, Topology, and Physics</a> and did
        focused studies on chapters 2-7 with an emphasis on examples and problems. The independent study culminated in me presenting an interesting example from Simplicial Homology in a QUEST talk.
      </p>
      <strong> Differential Topology Seminar</strong><br>
      <p class="ex">
        A once-weekly seminar on topics from differential topology presented to a group of interested students by Dr. <a class="'link" href="https://www.johnmyersmath.com/home"> John Meyers</a>. This seminar
        took place in the Spring22 semester and was what introduced me in part to differential topology, leading to my independent studies in General Relativity and Geometry and topology in Physics. The subject matter
        covered in this seminar highlights what I find most interesting in math, and is a subject that I hope to continue learning in the future.
